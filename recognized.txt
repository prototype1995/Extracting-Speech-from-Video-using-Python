I am Samsung ABC learning English people in the UK have a reputation for saying sorry a lot so let's have a look at different ways you can use to do was stay sorry you can be sorry and give him apologize in each case we addition to and forth to get the reason for apologizing I said sorry to my friend for forgetting have a nice day after 4 you can a gerund and now but if you want a simple statement to say I was wrong you can use any of these have you say this to my dad is very informal and he would probably only after making a small mistakes ever happen again in most serious situation
